Computer mouse
<br>Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to
make sure that it is of the highest quality.
<br>Accesability test, to confirm that anyone with can use the mouse properly
<br>Stress testing, to make sure it's as durable as promised
<br>Maybe unit testing to see if the buttons and and laser each work independently

<br><br>Catastrophic failure
<br>Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe
what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?
<br>Amazons new world causes problems with high end gpus. A small percentage of players experiences bricking of their brand new GPUs.
<br>The problem is both with amazon and the GPU manufacturer.
<br>The GPU manufactorers should've stress tested their products better as they claim a soldering problem contributed to the problems.
<br>Amazon should've had a wide array of machines to stress test their game on.

<br><br>Investigation of tools

<br><br>JUnit 5
<br>Investigate JUnit 5 (Jupiter). Explain the following, and how they are useful.
<br>• @Tag
<br>
<br>• @Disabled
<br>• @RepeatedTest
<br>• @BeforeEach, @AfterEach
<br>• @BeforeAll, @AfterAll
<br>• @DisplayName
<br>• @Nested
<br>• assumeFalse, assumeTrue

<br><br>Mocking frameworks
<br>Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least
two frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which
we saw in class.)
<br>• What are their similarities?
<br>• What are their differences?
<br>• Which one would you prefer, if any, and why?
